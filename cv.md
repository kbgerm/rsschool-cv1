## About myself:
I am a microbiologist, but recently I have decided to change my profession and become a programmer. Microbiology is an interesting and useful profession, but after working for two years in distribution, I realized that science is not exactly what I want to do in life. Programming for me is not so much a desire to earn money and be useful, but an opportunity to gain life experience and find a job that I like.

I consider communication skills and ability to work in a team as my strengths. Also, I really like to study and to learn new things, meet new people and gain experience and I'm hoping to success. This is my secont attempt to try myself in coding, and lately I didn't have enough time and strength to reach the top, but now I will do.
